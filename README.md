# Node.js MVC Backend Template 

I have created a simple Node.js MVC (Model-View-Controller) backend template. This template serves as a basic starting point for building Node.js applications using the MVC architectural pattern.

This template provides a structure for organizing your codebase and separating concerns into models, views, and controllers. It helps to maintain a clean and structured codebase, making it easier to manage and extend your application.




## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Tanv33/Backend-Template.git

```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Create an ENV file and provide environment variables

```bash

```
Start the server

  npm run start
```
